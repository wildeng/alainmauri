      I'm Alain! I really think that we should have a chat and here's why:

        <p>
          I think I'm a good at this job, I really do love development and the way you work really
          reverberates with me. The "Shape up" philosophy is what a development process should be,
          agile, with the right level of constraints and open to unleash the team's creativity.
        </p>
      </li>

        <p>
          I'm a Basecamp user and I really love the way it improved my day to day job, even though my
          current company is not adopting it. I've also used it to set up all the steps needed to get an interview with you.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Besides being only a user, I would like to be an advocate of the software I help to create and I would be
          really happy and proud of being part of a team whose creations spark joy to their users.
          I really believe this could be the best job of my life.
        </p>
