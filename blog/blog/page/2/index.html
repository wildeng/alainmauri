      <p>Despite my best efforts to consistently publish blog posts, I’ve found it challenging to maintain the required level of commitment. Opting for the latter, I’ve decided to write a post whenever inspiration strikes, sharing thoughts that hold personal meaning rather than aiming solely for a wide audience. Writing is an enjoyable endeavor for me, serving as a way to capture discoveries, experiences, and thoughts in a cohesive order.</p>

      <p>While reading the <a href="https://kddnewton.com/2023/11/30/advent-of-prism-part-0">Advent of Prism</a> about the new Ruby parser that’s now been integrated into runtimes and tooling I came across something that I had overlooked:</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/12/28/blocks-procs-and-lambdas/">Blocks Procs and Lambdas</a></h2>
      <p>Ruby has three types of anonymous functions: Blocks, Procs and Lambdas.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/12/23/editor-sacred-graal/">The Sacred Graal of Editors</a></h2>
      <p>In my last post I said that I wanted to be more technical and so be it. But in a different way and not “so technical”: I won’t talk about classes, methods, modules, mixin or some other Ruby related stuff. I’m going to write about my journey in search of my “almost perfect” editor.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/12/17/a-few-misses/">A few misses</a></h2>
      <p>It’s been a while since the last post but I had a couple of things that took me away from writing: A Christmas concert with the choir and my job which is highly demanding  in this period. More, I was finding difficult to find a good subject so I guess that sometimes is it ok to put out something that I found interesting? I guess so even if I’m not that sure about it, but at least it keeps the flow going.</p>
