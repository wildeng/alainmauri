      <p>Despite my best efforts to consistently publish blog posts, I’ve found it challenging to maintain the required level of commitment. Opting for the latter, I’ve decided to write a post whenever inspiration strikes, sharing thoughts that hold personal meaning rather than aiming solely for a wide audience. Writing is an enjoyable endeavor for me, serving as a way to capture discoveries, experiences, and thoughts in a cohesive order.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2024/01/19/ruby-learning-cultural-exploration/">Ruby Insights, Learning Journey, and Cultural Exploration</a></h2>
      <p>While reading the <a href="https://kddnewton.com/2023/11/30/advent-of-prism-part-0">Advent of Prism</a> about the new Ruby parser that’s now been integrated into runtimes and tooling I came across something that I had overlooked:</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/12/28/blocks-procs-and-lambdas/">Blocks Procs and Lambdas</a></h2>
      <p>Ruby has three types of anonymous functions: Blocks, Procs and Lambdas.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/12/23/editor-sacred-graal/">The Sacred Graal of Editors</a></h2>
      <p>In my last post I said that I wanted to be more technical and so be it. But in a different way and not “so technical”: I won’t talk about classes, methods, modules, mixin or some other Ruby related stuff. I’m going to write about my journey in search of my “almost perfect” editor.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/12/17/a-few-misses/">A few misses</a></h2>
      <p>It’s been a while since the last post but I had a couple of things that took me away from writing: A Christmas concert with the choir and my job which is highly demanding  in this period. More, I was finding difficult to find a good subject so I guess that sometimes is it ok to put out something that I found interesting? I guess so even if I’m not that sure about it, but at least it keeps the flow going.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/11/28/to-feed-or-not-to-feed/">To Feed or not Too Feed</a></h2>
      <p>Recently I started reading about the <a href="https://indieweb.org/?utm_source=ownyourweb&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=issue-03">Indie Web</a> movement, which is a people-focused alternative to the corporate owned one, and it really struck a chord.<br>
Principles like owning your content and being in control of what gets published are the things that got me started trying to understand how to build websites and to become a web developer.<br>
And after many years trying to use different platforms such as Wordpress, Medium, Dev etc. I went back to the most simple stuff: HTML, CSS and a simple RSS Feed - Atom to be honest.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/11/18/what-a-year/">1991 What a Year!</a></h2>
      <p>Personally it was quite an ordinary year, I didn’t have much time to study for the university because I was playing in a band and I didn’t have much time left. Honestly I was enjoying my time and not thinking too much about studying, but still doing a bit of programming on my C64c and exploring the UNIX mainframe of the University of Trieste IT department.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/11/11/a-light-in-the-shadow/">A Light in the Shadow</a></h2>
      <p>The past week at work has been quite nice from a personal perspective. I’ve delivered a couple of nice cool features and sorted out an interesting bug.
I cannot say much about the contest but I’m working in a software company that creates tools for professional sport teams and we deal with games and periods. We thus had the following problem: After creating a game with a certain duration and a certain number of periods, the UI was always displaying 90 minutes and 2 periods of 45 minutes.
<br>

<br>
So I started tracing down the bug and found the cause: A case of variable shadowing.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/11/02/back-again/">Writing in a Rainy Day</a></h2>
      <p>Today I’m writing from a soggy Sheffield and this is probably the right time to open the laptop and start thinking about what to say. Finding the right topics is not an easy task, especially for someone that’s not used to “common” writing - I do write a lot of code during the day though <img class="emoji" title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20"> - and therefore I’m always scared of a blank page and that’s why I usually start by adding the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Things I like</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Today's links</code>. But when the topic has been decided, well words flow smoothly.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/10/28/back-to-blogging/">A New Start</a></h2>
      <p>It’s been a while since last time I wrote a blog post about something. I do not know what happened but I had the feeling that it wasn’t worth doing it anymore.
I think that my expectations were so high that it’s been hard accepting the truth: In the world outside there are so many people writing about anything, and some of them
are so good, that my posts were just a drop in a vast ocean of information.</p>
