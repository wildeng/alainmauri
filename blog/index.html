      <p>It’s been a while since last time I wrote a blog post about something. I do not know what happened but I had the feeling that it wasn’t worth doing it anymore.
I think that my expectations were so high that it’s been hard accepting the truth: In the world outside there are so many people writing about anything, and some of them
are so good, that my posts were just a drop in a vast ocean of information.</p>
