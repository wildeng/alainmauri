Many things are recently going on in my mind, but I guess it's just part of that process called aging. I'm having that feeling that I still have so many things to do and learn ([Kenny G.](https://album.link/i/258622449) is playing in the background) but the time left is not enough.
Despite this and the fact that I'm not that fast as a developer as before - never been a 10x though... more a 2x :smile: - I'm still enjoying writing in that bizarre language called "code" and share my small achievements in blog posts, even though I realized
that I have to write when I feel too and not with a predefined routine. This is what I am and I think I'm not going to change much... 
Anyway I enjoy writing with my usual editor (Neovim or Lunarvim) but I don't enjoy copy pasting things around. More I was in the process of learning how to use the [Thor](http://whatisthor.com) gem so I said to myself that probably the best thing to do learn how it works is building something wih it. 
It took me less than one hour to build an alpha version of my personal blogpost generator and you can find the code [here](https://github.com/wildeng/wildeng.github.io/blob/55bac77ea91252e72c3c45f8b57593d20f3b0454/_scripts/blogpost.rb). 
<br/>
More, I already have in my mind some improvements:
<br/>
Add some validations to the name and date passed as arguments 
<br/>
Add the possibility to set up a customisable path for saving the file. I'm just thinking about how to organise posts e.g. by category 
<br/>
Maybe add a file path to a template as a /a/ameter. In this way I could potentially change the structure of my posts and make the generator more general.  

I probably have many more improvements in my mind but the music is almost over and the beer is finished - It's a Saturday evening so I can indulge a bit more with drinks!

Cheers!
<br/>
By the way, I also added some animation to my career page, check it out!
