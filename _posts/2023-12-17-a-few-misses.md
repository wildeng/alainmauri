title: A few misses
---

It's been a while since the last post but I had a couple of things that took me away from writing: A Christmas concert with the choir and my job which is highly demanding  in this period. More, I was finding difficult to find a good subject so I guess that sometimes is it ok to put out something that I found interesting? I guess so even if I'm not that sure about it, but at least it keeps the flow going.

I promise that the next one will be more interesting and probably more tech oriented.

In the meantime the question is: Will Ruby 3.3 be released on Christmas day? Fingers crossed :smile:
