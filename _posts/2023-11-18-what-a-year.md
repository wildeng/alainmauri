title: 1991 What a Year!
---

Personally it was quite an ordinary year, I didn't have much time to study for the university because I was playing in a band and I didn't have much time left. Honestly I was enjoying my time and not thinking too much about studying, but still doing a bit of programming on my C64c and exploring the UNIX mainframe of the University of Trieste IT department.

Rock Music was mainstream and big names - Metallica, Nirvana, REM, Extreme, Pearl Jam  where battling for number ones. So many good albums have been released that year from artists like Nirvana [Nevermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevermind), Metallica ["Black Album"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica_(album)), R.E.M. [Out of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_Time_(album)), Guns'n'Roses [Use your Illusion I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_Your_Illusion_I)  and [Use your Illusion II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_Your_Illusion_II), Pearl Jam [Ten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_(Pearl_Jam_album)), RHCP [Blood Sugar Sex Magik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Sugar_Sex_Magik) and many others - e.g. Soundgarden, Stone Temple Pilots, Alice in chains etc. 

##### <b>On the tech side</b> #####
On the 6th of August 1991 the first website [info.cern.ch](http://info.cern.ch) ever was published by the Cern in Geneva and hosted on Tim Berners Lee's NEXT computer and if I'm here throwing random words out in the wild is because of him and his work that changed the life of so many people around the world.

Linus Torvalds released the Linux Kernel to several Usenet Groups [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Linux) 

Apple [PowerBook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook) series of laptop was introduced to the market

The Cray 1 supercomputer: Unfortunately I couldn't use it but the Maths department of my university had it and I've been able to see it displayed in a room after its operational period was over. What a cool design it had!
