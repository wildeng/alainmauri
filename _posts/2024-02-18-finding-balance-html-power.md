title: Finding balance, The Web and HTML's Power 
---
Despite my best efforts to consistently publish blog posts, I've found it challenging to maintain the required level of commitment. Opting for the latter, I've decided to write a post whenever inspiration strikes, sharing thoughts that hold personal meaning rather than aiming solely for a wide audience. Writing is an enjoyable endeavor for me, serving as a way to capture discoveries, experiences, and thoughts in a cohesive order.

In my current job, I predominantly work on backend applications with occasional forays into frontend development. Despite the shift, I still find joy in working on simple HTML and CSS projects. Recently, I stumbled upon a fascinating book by [John Duckett](https://htmlandcssbook.com) in a charity shop, published in 2011. Despite its age, the book encapsulates fundamental web development knowledge in an aesthetically pleasing format.

Beyond its technical insights, the book has become a valuable visual aid, helping me understand how different elements fit into a webpage. It's not just about the technicalities; the book has inspired me to appreciate the artistry in web development. Although I often turn to search engines for quick answers, there's a unique satisfaction in slowing down and leafing through a physical book.

Speaking of which, let me delve into the book's influence on my work. The way it's structured has not only enriched my technical understanding but also provided a visual framework for organizing elements on a page. This, coupled with the nostalgia of using a tangible resource, has added a unique layer to my learning experience.

HTML, a language I consider powerful, has granted countless individuals the ability to express themselves on the vast canvas of the internet. Despite the ongoing debate about whether HTML is a programming language, its significance in enabling digital expression cannot be overstated. As I continue my journey in web development, I find solace in the simplicity and potency of HTML, a language that empowers creativity on the worldwide web.

Here are two examples from the book:

I just discovered - from an account I follow on Mastodon - that in Japan you can find magazines whose subjects are Yakuza families and it looks like the average Japanese salary man enjoys them quite a lot as a way to escape the day to day life - scroll to find the link to the article.
