This is a static website created with Jekyll, you can use it as a template for your projects.
It is served through Github pages, using a shell script that merges only the generated html to my master branch.

I found the script reading this nice [post](https://pulkitsharma07.github.io/2017/09/23/using-jekyll-and-github-pages/)
