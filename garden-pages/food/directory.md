### :love_letter: Simply Food

#### I love food and cooking. I think that you can easily express the love for someone through cooking.

#### A version of [chicken curry](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/46822/indian-chicken-curry-ii/) I tried as it is :yum: and also in a modified version using oat milk in place of coconut one.

#### Super simple [Dhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/GifRecipes/comments/6mcje8/super_simple_dhal/) :yum: it takes 30 minutes and it's super tasty

#### The kind of peppers I'm currently growing: [Serrano peppers](https://www.chilipeppermadness.com/chili-pepper-types/medium-hot-chili-peppers/serrano-peppers/)

#### If you never tried this Serbian hamburger well... do it now! :yum: [Pljeskavica](https://www.thespruceeats.com/serbian-pljeskavica-hamburgers-1135899)
